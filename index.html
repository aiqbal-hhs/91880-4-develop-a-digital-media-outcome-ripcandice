   <h1> strength and conditioning </h1>  

	<!--this is a paragraph-->
	<p> At its most basic level, strength and conditioning is the application of sports science to improve movement quality. It is based on scientific information as well as exercise physiology and anatomy. Because we all move, a higher quality of movement can benefit us all. Conditioning is a type of exercise that aims to improve the performance of your cardiovascular system. You're still pushing your muscles hard, and it may feel like strength training because your weights are still 'heavy,' despite the fact that you're using much smaller weights during workouts when you'd normally use more.Strength training is for those with specific goals to build muscle, improve joint function, increase overall endurance and physical conditioning. When you think of “strength training” think of someone engaged with a serious gym program, and who may be training for a particular sport or activity.</p>
